TTStyleBuilder is an interactive tool for creating and exploring Three20's TTStyle rendering pipelines. The tool can run in either the iPhone simulator or directly on the device.

One of the guiding principles while implementing this tool is that everything should be accomplished solely by extending Three20 without making any modifications to the source code. In order to do this, TTStyleBuilder relies heavily on the Objective-C runtime to dynamically reflect on the system in memory.

Current status is alpha. I have only been working on this since June 16th.

When browsing the structure of a style, you can enter 'editing' mode by double-tapping the live style preview area at the bottom of the screen. This will allow you to delete styles from the pipeline and to rearrange the styles within the pipeline (please see KNOWN BUGS below). Double-tap the live preview area again to stop the editing mode.

Right now there is no provision for saving your work. Future versions will allow you to construct TTStyleSheet subclasses and archive them to disk in the same manner as Interface Builder archives view hierarchies. Eventually I will add support for reading these TTStyleSheet archives from disk directly into a running Three20 application.

Also, many of the property editor plugins have not been implemented. 

KNOWN BUGS:
- when rearranging the order of styles, if you drag a style up to the very top and then try to delete it, bad things will happen.
- you cannot delete the first row (nor rearrange it).
- when browsing a style sheet, only selectors that do not take any arguments are shown (so stuff like "blackToolbarButton:" will not be shown because it takes an argument). This might be impossible to fix without making changes to TTStyle.{h,m} which is something that I've been reluctant to do.
